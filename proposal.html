      <h2>Problem Description</h2>
      <p>
        The topic domain for our project focuses on campus safety concerns for
        students at the University of Washington (UW) Seattle campus. Campus
        safety is a critical issue that impacts the well-being and security of
        students, faculty, and staff. With a large and bustling urban campus
        environment, UW Seattle faces various safety challenges, including but
        not limited to theft, assault, harassment, and navigating poorly lit or
        unfamiliar areas at night. These concerns not only affect individual
        safety but also influence the overall campus atmosphere and student
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        One information technology problem in this space is the lack of a
        comprehensive and user-friendly tool that provides real-time safety
        information, resources, and assistance tailored to the UW-Seattle
        community. While there are existing campus safety resources such as blue
        light emergency phones, campus police services, and safety escort
        programs accessing and navigating these resources efficiently can be
        troublesome and may not always align with the diverse needs of students.
        In terms of previous attempts to address campus safety through
        technology, the SafeCampus app offers features such as emergency
        contacts, reporting options, and safety tips, but it may still face
        challenges in meeting the diverse needs of students. Issues such as user
        awareness, app usability, and the comprehensiveness of safety resources
        could impact the app's effectiveness in addressing campus safety
        concerns.
