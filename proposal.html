        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>The topic domain for our project focuses on campus safety concerns for students at the University of Washington (UW) Seattle campus. Campus safety is a critical issue that impacts the well-being and security of students, faculty, and staff.
            With a large and bustling urban campus environment, UW Seattle faces various safety challenges, including but not limited to theft, assault, harassment, and navigating poorly lit or unfamiliar areas at night. 
            These concerns not only affect individual safety but also influence the overall campus atmosphere and student experience.</p>
        <p>One information technology problem in this space is the lack of a comprehensive and user-friendly tool that provides real-time safety information, resources, and assistance tailored to the UW-Seattle community. While there are existing campus 
            safety resources such as blue light emergency phones, campus police services, and safety escort programs accessing and navigating these resources efficiently can be troublesome and may not always align with the diverse needs of students. 
            In terms of previous attempts to address campus safety through technology, the SafeCampus app offers features such as emergency contacts, reporting options, and safety tips, but it may still face challenges in meeting the diverse needs of students. 
            Issues such as user awareness, app usability, and the comprehensiveness of safety resources could impact the app's effectiveness in addressing campus safety concerns.</p>
